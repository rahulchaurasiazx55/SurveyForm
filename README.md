# SurveyForm
Forms are always an essential part of any project that is used to collect user input information. In this article, we are creating a survey form for users using HTML and CSS. In this form, there are several questions that asked by users. Here, we will use HTML to design the basic layout of the form and CSS will give a beautiful design to our layout like text-decoration, text color, background color, text alignment, margin, padding, etc.
